## Course description

Reproducibility of experiments is one of the essential components of the
modern science. Since most work in Computational Linguistics (CL) and
Natural Language Processing (NLP) heavily rely on experiments
(typically with Machine Learning methods), reproducibility is also an
important concern for computational linguists. Reproducibility is not
only relevant to (scientific) research. It is also important for
most, if not all, "natural language engineering" tasks: it is crucial
for any practical NLP method to show as good performances in real-world
usage as the performance observed during development.

In the first part of the course, we will review some of the basic
concepts behind reproducibility in science, focusing on
reproducibility of methods used in machine learning and NLP. The
second part of the course will take a more practical approach.
The participants are required to choose a published article in
CL or related fields, and reproduce the results presented in the
article.

The course can be taken either as a 6CP HS (participation,
project and project presentation) or as a 9CP course with an
additional of term paper describing the project.
